remove all references to .setPosition
remove left and right wheel sensor
change leftMotor and rightMotor to /cmd_vel
    - create publisher that runs in a thread with the ability to call methods on
make an action server to rotate?
or just make a method in a node that is callable to rotate the robot a get_bearing_in_degrees

figure out what compute_path_length does and if we need to remove/reimplement it

in atGoal we may not have getTime or any time functionality in general

sensors integrated (supposedly):
    - lidar -> self.boundaries
    - bump sensor -> self.collided
    - goal sensing

sensors to go:
    - head direction - derived from odometry

actuators to go:
    - set motor speeds -> forward, stop

    - rotate degrees -> turn
